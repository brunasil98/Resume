                            LoRa Proximity Model for Indoor Space

        This is my final final project during Electronic and Electric Engineering Program at Norfolk State University. I completed it with my classmate Mrs. Alcaraz and our tutor, Dr. Guo. This was an application of LoRa technology. LoRa (short for long range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from spread spectrum (CSS) technology developed by Semtech. LoRa devices enable IoT applications that solve the biggest current challenges in the world, such as energy management, pollution control, etc. It communicates through low power (928- MHz in the US) and enables long range transmissions up to 20 km (in open rural environments) and up to 2-3 km in urban environments with an outdoor gateway. This opens up a new world of possibilities of implementations to solve problems in rural and urban areas. Therefore, we decided to give our project a focus on the urban implementation side. 
  The goal of our project is to analysis the signal losses (Db power loss in our system) and create a model which could predict the distance between the gateway and end-node.Knowledge in wireless communication, Arduino software, microcontrollers and mathematics was required for the desired outcome. The model can be used to implement smart systems that provide important information to the user. Aa an example, a fire situation. The approximate localization of the fire can be tracked easily.
