Hello,

This report discusses convolutional neural networks, which have the ability to label to each pixel of an image. This was created by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox at University of Freiburg. This was a breakthrough in image segmentation, as it gives a label for each pixel through a extend convolutional network which is known as U-Net. The implementation is very important for the biomedical field. This report applied the network to cells in order to find the precise edge of a cell. Hence, the cell can be easily measured, and, according to how it stretches, one can determine if the cell is cancerous or not.
