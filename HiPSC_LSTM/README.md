# MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SIMULATION OF CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

  Over the years, various attempts have been made towards explaining and reproducing the electrical activity of the heart. A wide array of models ranging from mechanistic to empirical models, cellular levels through tissue levels to even organ levels have been proposed. While some of these models answered some “big questions” in the field, one major challenge that persists is the computational complexity of these models. With the emergence of deep learning techniques, it has become relatively easy to build and deploy empirical “data-driven” models. This offers a wealth of opportunities for gaining new insight into the workings of the heart that current models are unable to offer.
  
  The data that we used to train the model was synthetically generated by silico hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocyte Model Built With Genetic Algorithm created by Akwasi D. Akwaboah1, Bright Tsevi, Pascal Yamlome, Jacqueline A. Treat, Maila Brucal-Hallare, Jonathan M. Cordeiro and Makarand Deo. Using the hiPSC model, we blocked the ICaL, IK1, IKr, IKur and INa currents amount of 0% to 200% with step of 20%. In each interaction was created a 100,000ms of action potential. To create the final data, we collected 3 samples of 10,000 ms for each 100,000 data generated due to the high memory this takes to be training.

  To create the network architecture, we used a LSTM with 5 input neurons, which were the current values, and 12000 output neurons; A second layers was created with 12000 out neurons and the last layers was a dense with 10,0000 out neurons which represents the action potential predicted. To the compile, we used loss as mean squared error and optimizer as RMSprop. Totally the model had 840,310,000 parameters

  The results we collected so far has been very promise, we are still adjusting the numbers of epochs, the location of the action potion start point on each sample, and how much data the computer can performance without shuts down.
