These are the three models I did for my semiconductor project.

Taking pictures of imperfections in a sillicon wafer, I created a CNN model to detected the inperfections.

Model 1 was the base model. 
For the second model I changed the mode in which the image passes through .fromarray 
In the third model I added dropout and and increased the numper of epochs.
