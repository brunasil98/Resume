Hey Dear, 

This is three model I have done in my semiconductor project.

We have pictures from imperfection of a sillicon wafer, 
I created a CNN model to be able to detected this inperfection.

Model 1 was the first model I did to get in the goal. 
For second model I changed the mode how the image pass through .fromarray 
And the third model I added dropout and and increased the numper of epochs.
